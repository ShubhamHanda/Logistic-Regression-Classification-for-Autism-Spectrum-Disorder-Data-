# Logistic-Regression-Classification-for-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Data-
Logistic Regression Model that helps predict the diagnosis of Autism

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods.

In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.
 
The data is a subset of data from Dr. Fadi Fayez Thabtah, Department of Digital Technology, Manukau Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand. 
 
The goal of this project that someone else can take the model and apply it to a new dataset.
